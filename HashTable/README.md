# Hashtable Project
**About: This project focused on how to use collision resolution methods (CRMs) to effectively add and search for data into an array of a record data type**
  - Used C++
  - User can choose to build the table from a file, then keep adding records to the table using a CRM:
    - Linear Probing
    - Quadrating Probing
    - Double Hashing using key/tablesize as the const increment

# PostFix Evaluation Project
**About: This project focused on how to use stacks and linked lists to evaluate an input postfix evaluation expression**
  - Used C++
  - User can enter any expression (as long as it is in postfix form)
    - Parses the expression and decides whether the current character is an operand or operator
    - Knows if an expression is valid or not
  - *Learning outcomes:*
    - [x] Learned how to make a stack using a linked list form
    - [x] Learned how to parse a character array and sort each term

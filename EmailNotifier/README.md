# Email Notifier
- When a user starts the client, they must enter a valid email, password, email service, and check interval.
- If the connection is valid, the program will check the email using the IMAP protocol and check if there are new emails.
- If there are new emails, the program will (optionally) play a sound, and show a popup containing the email subject and sender.
### Learning Outcomes:
✔️ Learned how to use email protocols  
✔️ Learned how to play a sound in Java

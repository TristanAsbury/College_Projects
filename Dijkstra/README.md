# Dijkstra Algorithm
- When started, the program will prompt the user to enter a half-matrix of node distances from each other.
- The user must then enter a valid source node
- If the file path exists, the program will calculate the "lowest-cost" path from the entered node to all other nodes
- The program then displays all of these distances and the routes
### Learning Outcomes:
✔️ Learned how to implement Dijkstra's Algorithm
✔️ Worked on becoming comfortable with file reading in C++

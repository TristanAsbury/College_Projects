# Broadcaster
- When a user starts the client, they must enter a client identifier (username).
- If the username is valid, they may try to connect to the server. If they can't, the program will show a prompt and exit.
- If the connection is successful, the user may send a message which gets relayed to all other clients connected to the server.
### Learning Outcomes:
✔️ Learned how to implement and use the Runnable interface  
✔️ Learned how to handle multiple concurrent clients connected to one server

# Broadcaster Project
- When the user runs the program, the console it is ran in turns black and waits a random amount of time.
- After that period, three (3) random characters show up in random positions on the console.
- When the user presses keys, the program reads them and compares to the randomly chosen characters. If they type a correct key twice, or type the wrong character, their progress is reset in that instance.
- If they type all correct characters once, the game ends with their reaction time.
### Learning Outcomes:
✔️ Learned how to generate random numbers using a pseudo-random equation.  
✔️ Practiced using C style functions (procedures)

### COMP 2200 OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
**Calculator Project**
  - Used java's simple JComponent system to create a basic user interface that allows the user to type into a textfield (which is validated during runtime)
  - Project has four simple options along with an inverse option to get the inverse:
    - Square Root
    - Sine
    - Cosine
    - Log
  - *Learning outcomes:*
    - [x] Learned how to use java's different listeners
    - [x] Learned how to use button groups for radio buttons
    - [x] Learned how to use different layout types
    
  
### COMP 2270 DATA STRUCTURES
#### Hashtable Project 
**About: This project focused on how to use collision resolution methods (CRMs) to effectively add and search for data into an array of a record data type**
  - Used C++
  - User can choose to build the table from a file, then keep adding records to the table using a CRM:
    - Linear Probing
    - Quadrating Probing
    - Double Hashing using key/tablesize as the const increment

#### PostFix Evaluation Project
**About: This project focused on how to use stacks and linked lists to evaluate an input postfix evaluation expression**
  - Used C++
  - User can enter any expression (as long as it is in postfix form)
    - Parses the expression and decides whether the current character is an operand or operator
    - Knows if an expression is valid or not
  - *Learning outcomes:*
    - [x] Learned how to make a stack using a linked list form
    - [x] Learned how to parse a character array and sort each term

# What is this?
- The directories in this repository contain source code for the projects related to my coursework at Fairmont State University.
- In each directory you'll find the file(s) containing the source code for the project as well as a description and learning outcomes of the projects.
- You may see some of these projects in their own repository. This is the case for larger projects that have taken more time to develop.


# Why?
- I made this repository to keep track of my programming skills and to learn version control.
